@par Example Description:

This example describes how to operation HT32 FLASH no halt.

When HT32 Flash doing erase or program, the CPU will be halted and cannot execute F/W.

Therefore, by placing the necessary function and vector in RAM (0x2000_0000),
the HT32 can still execute a small part of F/W during HT32 Flash doing erase or program,
and reduce the possibility of the halt to a limited extent.
