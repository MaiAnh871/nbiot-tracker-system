@par Example Description:

This example shows how to use the xxTM peripheral to count the number of pulses on an input pin.
  1. Configure the TMn CH0 as an input capture mode (rising edge)
  2. Set the Slave Trigger Input (STI) source as Filtered Input of CH0 (TI0S0, TRSEL=b0001).
  3. Set the TMn as slave mode, trigger by STI (SMSEL = b111).

               ^                                                    v               
         First Rising Edge                                                          
       ->Begin 100ms counter                               100ms counter interrupt  
           "StartValue"                                      "gCAP_Counter"      

   Note: 1.gCAP_Counter = (OverflowCounter * 65536) + (TM_GetCounter(HTCFG_CAP_PORT))
         2.gCompensate_Counter = (gCAP_Counter/10000) -> to compensate back
         3.Freq_divd_by_10 = gCAP_Counter + gCompensate_Counter
         4.Input Signal Freq = Freq_divd_by_10 * 10 (Hz)
           e.g. as shown above , 30 Hz Signal in 100ms , get gCAP_Counter = 3 , so Input Signal Freq = 30 Hz
  </PRE>

After the above setting, the counter of TMn will be incremented by one on the rising edge of xxTM CH0.

@par Hardware and Software Environment:

- This example can be run on the HT32 series development kit.
- Connect a Input Signal to the xxTM CHn input pin. Refer "ht32_board_config.h" for pin assignment.
- Generate a rising edge on the xxTM CHn input pin to clock the timer.
- When 100ms counter interrupt, the message shall be output, As follows
  "=============================="
  "OverflowCounter   = xxxxx"
  "CAP Timer Counter = xxxxx"
  "Freq_divd_by_10   = xxxxx"
  "Input Signal Freq = xxxxxx Hz"
